                ABOUT THIS GAME
            </h2>
            <p>In 2013 the world was devastated by an apocalyptic event, annihilating almost all mankind and turning
                the
                Earth's surface into a poisonous wasteland. A handful of survivors took refuge in the depths of the
                Moscow underground, and human civilization entered a new Dark Age.
            </p>
            <p>The year is 2033. An entire generation has been born and raised underground, and their besieged Metro
                Station-Cities struggle for survival, with each other, and the mutant horrors that await outside.
                You
                are Artyom, born in the last days before the fire, but raised underground. Having never ventured
                beyond
                the city limits, one fateful event sparks a desperate mission to the heart of the Metro system, to
                warn
                the remnants of mankind of a terrible impending threat.
            </p>


            <p>Your journey takes you from the forgotten catacombs beneath the subway to the desolate wastelands
                above,
                where your actions will determine the fate of mankind. But what if the real threat comes from
                within?
            </p>
